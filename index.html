        <h1>Hey! It's me, Aaron</h1>
        <p>Welcome! It's good to see you're giving my website hosted at <a href="github/com" target="_blank">github.com</a> a checkout.</p>
        <p>Thought I'd see how a web page gets <em>hosted</em> from a <em>repo.</em> At the same time, I'm messing with branch checkouts and merges in this project.</p>
        <h3>Hot dang it's a list...</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="./pages/linkedpage01.html">A link to a page</a></li>
                <li>And <a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/git-branching/" target="_blank">here's something</a> I'm following along with while making these few pages.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Well that's the whole site. Pretty disapointing</p>
